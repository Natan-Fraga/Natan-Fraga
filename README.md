Hi, I'm Natan Fraga, but you can call me Natan. I'm passionate about Web design and Front-end development. Currently, I'm on a journey to enhance my programming skills and become the best version of myself. A fun fact about me: I strive to be the best at everything I do. If I don't know something, you can bet I'm in the process of learning it.
